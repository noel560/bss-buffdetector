**AI-powered real-time buff tracker for Bee Swarm Simulator (Roblox)**

## Description
This tool is built for serious late-game Bee Swarm players who run Red or White fields and want to squeeze out every possible drop of pollen and honey.

Using real-time YOLO detection, it instantly recognizes Precision, starts an accurate 60-second countdown, and alerts you with voice ("Precision") and a clean on-screen timer exactly when the buff is about to expire.

## Features
- Real-time YOLO detection
- 60-second timer with visual countdown
- Voice alert ("Precision") when refresh time approaches
- Always-on-top, minimal GUI
- Portable – single folder or installer version available
- No false positives after fine-tuning
